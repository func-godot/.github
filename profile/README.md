***FuncGodot*** is a plugin for [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/) that allows users to generate Godot scenes using the [Quake MAP file format](https://quakewiki.org/wiki/Quake_Map_Format). Map files can be made in a variety of editors, the most commonly recommended one being [TrenchBroom](https://trenchbroom.github.io/). It is a reworking and rewrite of the [Qodot](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/Qodot) plugin for Godot 3 and 4.
